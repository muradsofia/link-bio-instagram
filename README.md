# link-bio-instagram

## About
This was my first HTML and CSS project. It my version of a linktree website for a friend's brand. 

## Demo
[Link](https://link-bio-instagram.netlify.app/). 
It's not complete, I'll keep working on it.

## Lessons learned
I learned more about thinking of container, how to structure my code, about flexbox, how to use git and also how to use a cdn.
